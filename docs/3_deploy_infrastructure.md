# Step 3: Deploy Infrastructure
This step will create a new EKS cluster and deploy the application.

## Prerequisites
1. Follow 0_safety_first.md and rename the current git checkout directory to the environment name you are going to deploy, if you have not done so already. You may need to reconnect the remote development environment as the file contents are moved out of the current working directory.
2. Follow 2_publish_sapio_bls_container_image.md to publish the container image to ECR, if you have not done so already.
3. Ensure you have completed init terraform backend per instruction in 1_build_terraform_backend.md.
4. Ensure the EC2 is still attached to the expected IAM role with required permissions, as described in 1_build_terraform_backend.md.

## Create TFVARS file.
In terraform/environment folder, copy the template.tfvars or one of the preset environment tfvars, rename to the working directory name.
Set the **env_name** variable to the working directory name.

Set the **sapio_bls_docker_image** to the published ECR image URI. It should be a concatenation of the repo section and the tag section of the docker image you listed earlier.
If you forgot, you can use the following command to find out the docker image repo name and tag.
```shell
sudo docker image ls
```
The image path is in format of `<aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<image_name>:<tag>`.

Set the **analytic_server_docker_image** to the analytic server version corresponds to the platform version you have installed. You can browse the available versions in the [Dockerhub Repoistory](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sapiosciences/sapio_analytics_server/tags).

Set the **sapio_server_license_data** to the base64 encoded license file content of "exemplar.license" that is shipped to you by Sapio. The license file must be entitling the AWS account and NOT the Mac Address. 
> ðŸ’¡ TIP
> 
> To obtain the base64 encoded content, you can copy the license file to the remote development environment then run command "base64 exemplar.license -w 0" to get the encoded content.

Scan through all scaling variables to ensure they are set to your desired values.

## Run Script
Run starthere/deploy_cluster.sh to deploy the infrastructure.
